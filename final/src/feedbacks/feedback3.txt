	This web application gives the user the ability to search, track, and evaluate stocks.  However, there are some functionalities that can be improved.  For example, companies should be searchable by their actual names instead of their just their stock exchange abbreviation.  The home page display of “your stocks” is nice but the user should have some method to decide the sorting of the stocks (based on name, performance, total value, for example).  Since nothing else is shown on the homepage, the developers should also consider showing stocks grouped by different industries for users new to the platform.  This can also be an easy lead into suggesting stocks to new users based on the industries they are interested in.
