1. The graphs took some time to load, but being able to dynamically interact with the graphs is really cool.
2. The overall concept is interesting to allow users to manage their stocks.
3. Having to input the stock ticker instead of company name is a downside.
4. It might be better to have the functions of explore stock and predict stock in the same page.
